# Tic Tac Game - JavaScript Project

This is a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game using JavaScript. It provides a command-line interface for users to play the game against each other.

## Game Rules

Tic Tac Toe is a game played on a 3x3 grid. Two players take turns marking cells in the grid with their respective symbols, usually 'X' and 'O'. The objective of the game is to get three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to play the game.

## How to Play

2. The first player will be assigned the symbol 'X', and the second player will be assigned the symbol 'O'.

3. Players take turns clicking on the empty cells in the grid to place their symbols.

4. The game will automatically determine if a player has won or if it's a tie, and display the result on the screen.

5. To start a new game, simply refresh the page.
